# LobbyGuard-Suite

<h5>There has been an ongoing issue where installing one of our products, LobbyGuard, requires 15 steps with 8 separate installations. I have combined all of these steps and files into one GUI installer using pascal script. The original installation time takes about 25~60 minutes to complete. With this installer, it is timed to be completed within 15 minutes.

<h2>How it works

<h5>After clicking install, this installer will first run 2 separate installers silently while going through the main GUI to install LobbyGuard. Once this is complete, it will proceed to copy required files over and complete the rest of the installation.

<h2>Notes

<h5>-Admin credentials will always be required.
-The GUI will allow the user to decide which program to install.
